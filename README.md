I wanted to do the extra work of putting my Word-Guess-Game into objects but found that it was a pretty big job partly because of the extra features I had built into the Word-Guess-Game. So I built The-Psychic-Game and made it into an object from the get-go. There is no error-checking or niceties in this game, but it fulfills the assignment of The-Psychic-Game *and* I got to build an object that works.
